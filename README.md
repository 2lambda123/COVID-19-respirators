# COVID-19-respirators
JPL designed and tested 3D printed respirators to help with the COVID-19 pandemic response.
The designs and instructions for three different types of respirators and the resulting detailed test data is published here.
In addition, designs and instructions for custom filters are also included.
You can review JPl's test results but these respirators are not certified by NIOSH or any medical institution, so use at your own risk.
